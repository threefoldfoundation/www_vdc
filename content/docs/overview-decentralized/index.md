# Decentralized eVDC

More than 80% of the cloud/internet infrastructure that exists today is owned by less than 20 organizations. This centralization of power and ownership does not lend itself to equality in the data economy. We have already seen examples of major abuse of individuals' data to the benefit of very few big tech corporations. 

The ThreeFold technology brings privacy by design, where all data and applications remain under the user's control, as well as any sharing of data with others. 
A decentralized architecture encourages equality by stopping the accumulation of big amounts of data with one party.
