# A VDC at the edge: local and affordable everywhere

Currently, 80% of data resides in hyperscale data centers, at central locations, and compute power is also centralized in the same locations. The trend is shifting however: it is expected that by 2025, most of the data will have moved closer to where it is used. Local storage of data and computation at the edge will be required for smart cities, self-driving cars, 5G, IoT, Virtual Reality and many more use cases where quick response times are critical.

Moreover, a centrally organized internet architecture is unsustainable: the internet already consumes as much as 10% of the world's power generation today. The extremely high entry cost for setting up data centers and their high dependency on reliable power and network infrastructure are major factors prohibiting the growth of digital infrastructure in emerging markets.

ThreeFold brings your data center to where you need it to be, in any scale, and very close to where it is consumed. We are facilitating the setup of infrastructure at the edge.
