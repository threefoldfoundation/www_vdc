# How to use eVDC

## First, visit the eVDC Deployer 

[Mainnet vdc](https://vdc.grid.tf) (coming soon)

[Testnet vdc](https://vdc.testnet.grid.tf)

- You'll see the option to create your Virtual Data Center.
- Simply choose the option you want to launch from the menu.
- You'll need to log in through ThreeFold Connect, an authenticator for the full ThreeFold ecosystem.
- You can find more on ThreeFold Connect [here](https://manual.threefold.io/#/threefold_connect_install).

## Next, use the guided setup to create your private VDC

- Options are there to reserve a new VDC in different sizes, delete it or extend with extra K8s clusters or in time.
- VDC comes with options for monitoring (using Grafana and Prometheus tooling).
- A wallet can be configured within the deployment website, enabling easy payment. 
- If you're feeling lost, each live tool has a tutorial on its page here on the wiki.

## Where to ask questions

- Feel free to ask us any questions you might have on [our forum](https://forum.threefold.io) in the feedback category.
- We also have a Telegram Group for TF Grid testers [here](https://t.me/joinchat/BwOvOxxgK59GmRoZ2_sM0w).

*Please keep in mind that eVDC is currently running on testnet. Mainnet is planned to be released early 2021.*

*Please forgive any instability you might encounter while our developers continue to work to bring you the best solutions possible and keep in mind the forum (linked directly above) is there for you to bring questions or report any issues.*
