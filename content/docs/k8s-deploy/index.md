# Deploy K8s Cluster

The Kubernetes cluster comes with the creation of your VDC. 

- This deployment creates the K3S Lightweight Kubernetes implementation in Zero-OS

  ![](./img/logo-k3s.png)
- K3S is full conformant production-ready Kuberrnetes distribution with the following changes:   
   - It is packaged as a single binary
   - It adds support to sqlite3 as default storage. Etcd3, MySQL and Postgres are also supported
   - It wraps Kubernetes and other components in a single, simple launcher
   - It is secure by default with reasonable defa&ults for lightweight environments
   - It eliminates the need to expose a port on Kubernetes worker nodes fopr the kubelet API by exposing this API to the Kubernetes control plain nodes over a websocket tunnel. 
   
   More info can be found [here](https://github.com/rancher/k3s)
   
   
   - You'll need to log in through Threefold Connect, an authenticator for the ThreeFold ecosystem.
     You can find more on ThreeFold Connect [here](https://manual.threefold.io/#/3botconnect_install).

## Next, use the guided setup to create and configure your private VDC

- Both K8S and storage have their own flow â€“ actions in order to deploy your own instance on top of the ThreeFold Grid.
- If you're feeling lost, each live tool has a tutorial on its page here on the wiki.
