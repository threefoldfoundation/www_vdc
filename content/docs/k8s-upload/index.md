# Upload Containers to a K8s Cluster

Uploading containers can be done using kubectl instructions, but doing it this way brings some inconveniences. Replacing just a couple of values in a file obliges you to copy-paste the entire file.

In order to help with that, we support the use of Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes. It helps to deploy complex application by bundling necessary resources into Charts, which contain all information to run an application on a cluster.
