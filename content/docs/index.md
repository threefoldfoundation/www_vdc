![](./img/vdc.png)

eVDC stands for "edge Virtual DataCenter" which is a solution that exists on the ThreeFold Grid. ThreeFold has created the largest active peer-to-peer cloud (the TF Grid) on the planet, which runs any Unix IT workload. 

The eVDC is a virtual data center (out of the box) that creates easy and industry standard ways to deploy, scale and manage Unix workloads. It presents  the most popular tooling available in the market to run applications. 

The eVDC offers the tooling for:
- Deploying containerized Unix IT applications on the grid
- Setting up Kubernetes clusters that are able to orchestrate and manage containers running on the ThreeFold grid and containers hosted on external clouds (hybrid cloud management)
- Storing data in a very secure way and presenting this storage facility in the most used and understood interface: a file system
