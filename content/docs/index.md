eVDC stands for "edge Virtual DataCenter". An eVDC is a solution on the ThreeFold grid. ThreeFold has created the largest active peer-to-peer cloud (the TF Grid) on the planet, which runs any Unix IT workload. 

The eVDC is a virtual data center (out of the box) that creates easy and industry standard ways to deploy, scale and manage Unix workloads.  It presents the most popular tooling available in the market to run Unix applications. 

The eVDC offers tooling for : 
- Deploying containerized Unix applications on the grid
- Setting up Kubernetes clusters and manage containers running on the Threefold grid and containers hosted on other clouds (hybrid cloud management) 
- Storing data securely and realibly and offering the most used and understood interface: a file system.
